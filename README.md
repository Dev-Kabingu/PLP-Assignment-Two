1. Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?

version control is a tool that records changes to codes and helps track changes and allow developers to collaborate and work on projects together.
it is popular as it allows developers to track changes and allow developers to collaborate seemlessly.
it maintains projects buy providing a centralized location where developers store and manage their codes and also collaborate. Also it help maintain project integrity by keeping record of all changes.


2. Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps, and what are some of the important decisions you must make during this process?
 
   login to github and click the green button "new" to create a repo.
   give a clear and a well descriptive name for the repo name
  choose whether you want it to be visible to all "public" or accessible to you only "private"
   include a README file which provides an overview description of the project.

3. Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
 
 it provides an overview of the project.
it includes explanation of what the project does, how to set up the project installation,the usage license rule and steps on how to use the project and also on how others can contribute.

4. Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
 
 public repository are visible and accessible by all while private repo are hide from others and only accessible to the developer.
advantage for public repo is that other can contribute to the project.
disadvantage is that the code is visible and accessible by all.
advantage for private is that code is only accessible to approved collaborators.
disadvantage to private repo is that they limit other developers from making their contribution to the project.
   
5. Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions
 of your project?

 a commit is a saved version of the project.
when regular commits are made to a project, they help developers to trck all the changes taking palce and also developers can revert back to a previous version.
the steps involved are : git init to initialize a repo, git add . to add files and git commit -m "commit message to be saved"

6. How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and
    merging branches in a typical workflow.

    branching is important as it helps developers create a separate version of a project without affecting or manipulating the main code project.
    it is important for collaborative developers as different developers can work on different features of the system being developed simultaneously without affecting each other.
    step: git branch branch-name , git switch branch-name, git merge branch-name. 

7. Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

pull requests allow developers who are collaborating to review changes made to code and approve them before merging them.
After changes made have been pushed to github, a pull request from the sub branch to the main branch is amde, where the developers review the codes, approve them or suggest changes
then once approved the pull request is merged.

8. Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

forking is the process of creating a copy of someone else repository on github.
forking allows one to push changes to their own github without affecting the original code while cloning only creates a local copy.
forking is useful when one wants to contribute to an open source where he can make changes and submit for reviews. it is also useful when one wants to experiment as the 
original project will not be affected.

9. Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

 the issues and project boards are important tools as they help in tracking projects, errors and also new feature requests.
 project board are used to visualize the project in a board layout while issues are used to report bugs track project progress and also suggest some improvements.
 
10. Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
